// RawAllocator is the simplest bump pointer allocator
// that can operate on top of once allocated byte slice.
//
// It has almost none safety checks, and it can't grow dynamically,
// but it is the fastest implementation provided by this library,
// and it is created as a building block that we use to implement other allocators.
//
// All critical path methods like `Alloc` and `ToRef` are designed to be inalienable.
//
// General advice would be to use other more high-level implementations like arena.GenericAllocator,
// available in this library, and refer to this one only if you really need to,
// and you understand all its caveats and potentially unsafe behavior.
